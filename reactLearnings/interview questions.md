1. What is React?

React is a front-end and **open-source JavaScript library** which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically
for
applications with a single page for mobile and web application

The important features of React are:

It supports **server-side rendering.**
It will make use of the **virtual DOM** rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
It follows **unidirectional data binding** or data flow.
It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.

2. What are the advantages of using React?
   **Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency:**
   **Gentle learning curve:**
   **SEO friendly:** React allows developers to develop engaging user interfaces that can be easily navigated in various
   search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.
   **Reusable components:** React uses component-based architecture for developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
   Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from: React provides you with the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing an application based on your requirement.
