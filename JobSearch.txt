my linked din profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/mukesh-u-8473a313/

The legacy system was monolithic, handling SIM card activations and tariff purchases with synchronous third-party integrations. It was slow, brittle, and unscalable‚Äîespecially during campaign spikes (e.g., Black Friday), where response times spiked and some services failed entirely.

üß© My Approach
1. Architecture Redesign
From Monolith to Microservices: Split the core domains (SIM lifecycle, Tariff management, User management) into isolated services using domain-driven design principles.

Event-Driven Communication: Introduced asynchronous messaging via Kafka for downstream operations like billing and notifications to reduce tight coupling.

API Gateway + Service Mesh: Used Spring Cloud Gateway and Istio for routing, resilience, and observability.

Resilience4j was added for timeouts, retries, and fallback.

2. Team Management
Ownership by Domain: Assigned each dev a microservice domain with full CI/CD responsibility.

Sprint Planning + Tech Deep Dives: Weekly technical huddles to unblock, align, and brainstorm.

Code Quality: Enforced coverage thresholds and peer reviews. Used SonarQube to maintain code quality KPIs.

Mentorship: Paired senior/junior devs for critical modules to accelerate onboarding and improve cross-functional skills.

3. Cloud & Infrastructure
GCP Migration:

Provisioned resources using Terraform (IaC)

Utilized GCP Pub/Sub, Cloud SQL, and GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) for container orchestration

Dockerized All Services: Ensured consistent builds and smooth CI/CD pipelines

CI/CD Pipelines: Built end-to-end pipelines with GitLab CI and Jenkins, including linting, testing, security scans, and auto-deploys.

4. Observability & Performance
Integrated ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and Prometheus + Grafana to monitor service health, error rates, and request latencies.

Defined SLOs and alerts to catch regressions early.
